# Grading Assignments
A program to distribute and track grading assignments to a team of TAs/graders so that work is realtively distributed while TAs can focus on 1-2 questions to maintain grading consistency.

This program is initially intended for distributing grading to CS 2050 Discrete Mathematics TAs but won't be course-specific.
