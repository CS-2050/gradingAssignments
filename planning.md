# Planning
This is a document to list out ideas and relations in preparation to starting


## Things to add
This is all just a brainstorm of possibilities and by no means what will be put into the end product.

- [ ] Input list of TA names for each semester
- [ ] Set level of grading expected for a TA (e.g. if they're to be assigned half-grading due to being part of the creation team or having other responsibilities)
- [ ] Track TA "points" or something? i.e. how much they've graded.
    - [ ] Maybe have it recalculate each time since there won't be much data and then we can update difficulties depending on feedback from the graders?

- [ ] Create semesters
- [ ] Create assignments/exams/things to grade within semesters 
- [ ] Create ability to have multiple versions of assignments/exams so that dif. versions someone can grade the same type of question?
- [ ] Ability have sub-questions that are the actual thing being assigned (e.g. 4.a, 4.b, 4.c, etc.)
    - [ ] Might be better to not do this and just block entire of one type of question together in case it's a propogation grading thing so that TAs can account for it?
    - [ ] Really depends on the question tbh
- [ ] Assign each actual grading question a "difficulty" level i.e. in terms of how long it takes to grade (pbly on a scale of 0-100)



- [ ] Maybe experiment with trying to keep TAs in "cohorts" / "groups" of TA grading for consistency? Might make it easier with groupchats and whatnot?
- [ ] Link same TAs over to new semesters / carryover them to link data?
- [ ] GradeScope "graded by" import to crosscheck/validate information?
- [ ] Method to account for exceptions (e.g. person A wasn't able to finish grading so we'll reallocate it but it'll automatically acount and record it so they might be allocated more later on)
- [ ] Method to account for those that have graded extra so we give them less later on
    - [ ] Exam grading parties external method that allocates? Different lengths / amounts result in like a propotional multiplier like with the "expected grading" level?
- [ ] Exception to expected grading (e.g. if 2051 TAs don't have a supplement then are able to help with grading)

- [ ] Account for late submissions and expected values -- be able to input the actual number graded later
- [ ] Account for preferences (i.e. late grading or not)
- [ ] Account for whether they usually grade early or not?
